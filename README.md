SETUP:

1. Get moverlay from here: https://github.com/bkacjios/m-overlay
(Code -> Download zip)

2. Make sure you can run the release.bat file inside the moverlay folder
- This requires some dependencies. Read their README for instructions

3. Download this git repo as zip (Code -> Download zip)

4. Replace main.lua in m-overlay-master/source folder with the main.lua in MeleeBadHabitQuitter

5. Run the release.bat file in m-overlay-master

6. Run m-overlay-master/build/application.love
   
7. Press Esc in moverlay:
- Debug Inputs -> Turn on Buttons (others are optional, functionality not (yet) implemented)
- Turn on Debug Console (optional, but shows errors when moverlay breaks)

Now anytime you want to boot it up, just:

1. Run melee

2. Run m-overlay-master/build/application.love

3. Run the MeleeBadHabitQuitter/Build/MeleeBadHabitQuitter.exe

If it doesn't work or suddenly stops working, try restarting moverlay and MeleeBadHabitQuitter (or shoot me a dm on discord: clubpengin)
